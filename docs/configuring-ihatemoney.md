# Setting up I hate money

This is an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) role which installs [I hate money](https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney) to run as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container wrapped in a systemd service.

"I hate money" is a self-hosted shared budget manager.

See the project's [documentation](https://ihatemoney.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to learn what "I hate money" does and why it might be useful to you.

## Prerequisites

To run an I hate money instance it is necessary to prepare a database. You can use a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) compatible database server, [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/), or [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/). The SQLite database file will be automatically created by the service if it is enabled.

If you are looking for Ansible roles for a MySQL compatible server or Postgres, you can check out [ansible-role-mariadb](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-mariadb) and [ansible-role-postgres](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/ansible-role-postgres), both of which are maintained by the [Mother-of-All-Self-Hosting (MASH)](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting) team.

## Adjusting the playbook configuration

To enable I hate money with this role, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file.

**Note**: the path should be something like `inventory/host_vars/mash.example.com/vars.yml` if you use the [MASH Ansible playbook](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook).

```yaml
########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# ihatemoney                                                           #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################

ihatemoney_enabled: true

########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# /ihatemoney                                                          #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################
```

### Set the hostname

To enable I hate money you need to set the hostname as well. To do so, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file. Make sure to replace `example.com` with your own value.

```yaml
ihatemoney_hostname: "example.com"
```

After adjusting the hostname, make sure to adjust your DNS records to point the domain to your server.

### Configuring database

#### Specify database (optional)

You can specify a database used by I hate money. By default it is configured to use Postgres.

To use SQLite, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file:

```yaml
ihatemoney_database_type: sqlite
```

Set `mysql` to use a MySQL compatible database. The SQLite database is stored in the directory specified with `ihatemoney_data_path`.

For other settings, check variables such as `ihatemoney_database_*` on [`defaults/main.yml`](../defaults/main.yml).

#### Configuring connection to the database server (optional)

By default the role is configured to establish the connection to the database server via a Unix socket. You can mount the Unix socket by adding the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file:

```yaml
# Specify the path to the MySQL compatible server's Unix socket path on the host (bind-mount source)
ihatemoney_database_mysql_socket_path_host: ""

# Specify the path to the Postgres Unix socket path on the host (bind-mount source)
ihatemoney_database_postgres_socket_path_host: ""
```

Setting it enables to connect to the database server via Unix socket mounted in the container.

If TCP connection is preferred, connection via the Unix socket can be disabled by adding the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file:

```yaml
# Disable the connection to the MySQL compatible server via a Unix socket
ihatemoney_database_mysql_socket_enabled: false

# Disable the connection to the Postgres server via a Unix socket
ihatemoney_database_postgres_socket_enabled: false
```

### Control project creation access (optional)

By default the instance is open to public and anyone can create a project. If you wish to limit who is capable of creating one, you can secure the instance with the admin password.

Note that the instance is automatically secured if the admin password is set to `ihatemoney_admin_password`. If you want to keep the instance public *while the admin password is set*, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file:

```yaml
ihatemoney_public_project_creation: true
```

### Extending the configuration

There are some additional things you may wish to configure about the service.

Take a look at:

- [`defaults/main.yml`](../defaults/main.yml) for some variables that you can customize via your `vars.yml` file. You can override settings (even those that don't have dedicated playbook variables) using the `ihatemoney_environment_variables_additional_variables` variable

See [the official documentation](https://ihatemoney.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html) for a complete list of I hate money's config options that you could put in `ihatemoney_environment_variables_additional_variables`.

## Installing

After configuring the playbook, run the installation command of your playbook as below:

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts setup.yml --tags=setup-all,start
```

If you use the MASH playbook, the shortcut commands with the [`just` program](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook/blob/main/docs/just.md) are also available: `just install-all` or `just setup-all`

## Usage

After running the command for installation, I hate money becomes available at the specified hostname like `https://example.com`.

### Enabling administrative tasks

By default all administrative tasks are disabled. You can enable them by defining the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable.

You can generate an administrator's hashed password by **SSH-ing into into the server** and running a command as below:

```sh
docker exec -it ihatemoney ihatemoney generate_password_hash
```

The generated value needs to be specified to the `ihatemoney_admin_password` variable on your `vars.yml` file:

```yaml
ihatemoney_admin_password: YOUR_HASHED_PASSWORD_HERE
```

Note that the value should contain the whole output of the command, including the hashing prefix, salt and key in the format as below:

```yaml
ihatemoney_admin_password: "scrypt:32768:8:1$....$......."
```

After populating the variable, re-run the installation command.

## Troubleshooting

### Check the service's logs

You can find the logs in [systemd-journald](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-journald.service.html) by logging in to the server with SSH and running `journalctl -fu ihatemoney` (or how you/your playbook named the service, e.g. `mash-ihatemoney`).
